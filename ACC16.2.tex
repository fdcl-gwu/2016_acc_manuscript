\section{Introduction}
Many researchers have focused on the study of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body~\cite{hughes2004,wertz1978}.
Rigid body attitude control arises for aerospace vehicles, ground and underwater vehicles, and robotic systems.
One distinctive feature of the attitude dynamics is that it evolves on a nonlinear manifold.
The three-dimensional special orthogonal group is the set of \( 3 \times 3 \) orthogonal matrices whose determinant is one.
This configuration space is not Euclidean and yields unique stability properties which are not observable on a linear space.
For example, it is impossible to achieve global attitude stabilization using continuous time-invariant feedback~\cite{bhat2000}.
Attitude control is typically studied using a variety of attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles or quaternions~\cite{shuster1993}.

% topological obstruction - smooth control system can only achieve almost global asymptotic stability

% discuss issues with parameterizations
All attitude parameterizations fail to represent the nonlinear configuration space both globally and uniquely~\cite{chaturvedi2011a}.
For example, minimal attitude representations, such as Euler angle sequences or modified Rodriguez parameters, suffer from singularities.
These attitude representations are not suitable for large angular slews.
In order to avoid singularities the designer must carefully switch the chosen Euler angle sequence based on the operating region.
Another option is to artificially limit the operating region of the rigid body.
This ensures the system operates in a region free from singularities but limits the performance capabilities and ability to perform arbitrarily large angular maneuvers.
Quaternions do not have singularities but they double cover the special orthogonal group.
As a result, any physical attitude is represented by a pair of antipodal quaternions on the three-sphere.
An immediate implication of this ambiguity is that closed-loop stability properties derived using quaternion may not hold for the physical rigid body evolving on the special orthogonal group.
During implementation, the design must carefully resolve this non-unique representation in quaternion based attitude control system to avoid undesirable unwinding behavior~\cite{bhat2000}.
For certain initial conditions, where the rigid body starts closed to the desired attitude, the system unnecessarily rotates through a large angle even while the initial error is small.

% introduce concept of state inequality constraints and how it creates a nonconvex region 
% mention applicability of this for spacecraft maneuvers, spherical air bearing testing, hardware limitations
Many physical rigid body systems must perform large angular slews in the presence of state constraints.
For example, autonomous spacecraft or aerial systems are typically equipped with sensitive optical payloads, such as infrared or interferometric sensors.
These systems require retargeting while avoiding direct exposure to sunlight or other bright objects.
Determining a satisfactory attitude control maneuver in the presence of state constraints is a challenging task.
The removal of constrained regions from the rotational configuration space results in a \textit{nonconvex} region.
The attitude control problem in the absence of constraints has been extensively studied~\cite{sanyal2008,lee2010,lee2011a}.
However, the attitude control problem in the presence of constraints has received much less attention.

% discuss how previous papers (mcinnes and lee/meshabi) have short comings
Several approaches have been developed to treat the attitude control problem in the presence of constraints.
A geometric approach is used in~\cite{hablani1999} to determine feasible attitude trajectories prior to implementation.
Typically, an optimal or easily implementable on-board control scheme for attitude maneuvers is considered without state constraints.
The algorithm then seeks an intermediate point such that the control scheme can be applied for each segment without violation of the constraints.
While the geometric method is conceptually simple it is difficult to generalize for an arbitrary amount of constraints.
In addition, this geometric type of approach is only applicable to problems where the selection of intermediate points are computationally feasible

The approach in~\cite{frazzoli2001} involves the use of randomized motion planning algorithms to solve the constrained attitude control problem.
A graph is generated consisting of vertices from an initial attitude to a desired attitude. 
A random iterative search is conducted to determine a path through the graph such that a given cost functional is minimized.
Once an appropriate path is determined an appropriate control is implemented to perform the attitude maneuver.
The random search approach can only stochastically guarantee attitude convergence as it can be shown that as the number of vertices in the graph grow, the probability of non convergence goes to zero.
However, the computational demand grows as the size of the graph is increased. 
As a result, random search approaches are ill-suited to on-board implementation or in scenarios that require agile maneuvers.

In this work, we develop a geometric adaptive controller on \SO to reorient a rigid body in the presence of state inequality constraints.
We apply a potential function based approach developed directly on the nonlinear manifold \SO.
Geometric control is concerned with the development of control systems for dynamic systems that evolve on nonlinear manifolds.
Artificial potential functions have previously been applied to the attitude control problem~\cite{lee2011b,mcinnes1994}.
These approaches have used attitude parameterizations that give rise to singularities and ambiguities.
By characterizing the intrinsic geometric properties of \SO, we completely avoid issues associated with local parameterizations of the configuration manifold.
In this paper, we present a Lyapunov analysis to guarantee stability in the presence of state constraints.
In addition, we formulate an adaptive update law to enable attitude convergence in the presence of disturbances.
These results are demonstrated via numerical examples and experimental results on a robotic aerial vehicle.

\section{Problem Formulation}

\subsection{Attitude Dynamics}
Consider the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. 
Define an inertial reference frame and a body-fixed frame. 
The configuration manifold of the attitude dynamics is the special orthogonal group:
\begin{align*}
	\SO = \{R\in\Re^{3\times 3}\,|\, R^TR=I,\;\mathrm{det}[R]=1\} \, ,
\end{align*}
where a rotation matrix $R\in\SO$ represents the transformation of the representation of a vector from the body-fixed frame to the inertial reference frame. 
The equations of motion are given by
\begin{gather}
	J\dot\Omega + \Omega\times J\Omega = u+W(R,\Omega)\Delta \, ,\label{eqn:Wdot}\\
	\dot R = R\hat\Omega \, ,\label{eqn:Rdot}
\end{gather}
where $J\in\Re^{3\times 3}$ is the inertia matrix, and $\Omega\in\Re^3$ is the angular velocity represented with respect to the body-fixed frame. 
The control moment is denoted by $u\in\Re^3$, and it is expressed with respect to the body-fixed frame. 
We assume that the external disturbance is expressed by $W(R,\Omega)\Delta$, where $W(R,\Omega):\SO\times\Re^3\rightarrow \Re^{3\times p}$ is a known function of the attitude and the angular velocity, and $\Delta\in\Re^p$ is an unknown, but fixed uncertain parameter.
In addition, we assume that a bound on \( W(R, \Omega) \) is known and given by
\begin{equation}
	\norm{W} \leq B_W \, . \label{eqn:W_bound}
\end{equation}

In~\refeqn{Rdot}, the \textit{hat} map $\wedge :\Re^{3}\rightarrow\so$ represents the transformation of a vector in $\Re^3$ to a $3\times 3$ skew-symmetric matrix such that $\hat x y = x\times y$ for any $x,y\in\Re^3$~\cite{BulLew05}. More explicitly, 
\begin{align*}
\hat x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -x_3 & x_2 \\ x_3 & 0 & -x_1 \\ -x_2 & x_1 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}
for $x=[x_1,x_2,x_3]^T\in\Re^3$. 
The inverse of the hat map is denoted by the \textit{vee} map $\vee:\so\rightarrow\Re^3$. Several properties of the hat map are summarized as
\begin{gather}
%    \hat x y = x\times y = - y\times x = - \hat y x,\\
    x\cdot \hat y z = y\cdot \hat z x,\quad \hat x\hat y z = (x\cdot z) y - (x\cdot y ) z\label{eqn:STP},\\
%    \hat x\hat y z = (x\cdot z) y - (x\cdot y ) z,\label{eqn:VTP}\\
%    C^TC=-C^T\hat e_3^2 C = I_2
%    \hat x^T \hat x = (x^T x) I - x x^T,\\
%    \hat x \hat y \hat x=-(y^Tx)\hat x,\\
%    -\frac{1}{2}\tr{\hat x \hat y} = x^T y,\\
    \widehat{x\times y} = \hat x \hat y -\hat y \hat x = yx^T-xy^T,\label{eqn:hatxy}\\
    %\tr{\hat x A}=
    \tr{A\hat x }=\frac{1}{2}\tr{\hat x (A-A^T)}=-x^T (A-A^T)^\vee,\label{eqn:hat1}\\
%    \widehat{Ax} = \hat x \parenth{\frac{1}{2}\tr{A}I-A} + \parenth{\frac{1}{2}\tr{A}I-A}^T \hat x,\\
    \hat x  A+A^T\hat x=(\braces{\tr{A}I_{3\times 3}-A}x)^{\wedge},\label{eqn:xAAx}\\
R\hat x R^T = (Rx)^\wedge,\quad 
R(x\times y) = Rx\times Ry\label{eqn:RxR}
%,\label{eqn:Rxy}
\end{gather}
for any $x,y,z\in\Re^3$, $A\in\Re^{3\times 3}$ and $R\in\SO$. 
Throughout this paper, the dot product of two vectors is denoted by $x\cdot y = x^T y$ for any $x,y\in\Re^n$ and the maximum eigenvalue and the minimum eigenvalue of $J$ are denoted by $\lambda_M$ and $\lambda_m$, respectively. 
The 2-norm of a matrix \( A \) is denoted by \( \norm{A} \), and its Frobenius norm is denoted by \( \norm{A}_F = \tr{A^T A} \).
This results in \( \norm{A} \leq \norm{A}_F \leq \sqrt{r}\norm{A} \), where \( r \) is the rank of A.

\subsection{State Inequality Constraint}

The two-sphere is the manifold of unit-vectors in \( \R^3 \) such that \( \Sph^2 = \{ q \in \R^3 \,  \vert \, \norm{q} = 1 \}\).
We define \( r \in \Sph^2 \) to be a unit vector from the mass center of the rigid body and represented with respect to the body-fixed frame.
For example, \( r \) may represent the pointing direction of an on board optical sensor.
We define \( v \in \Sph^2 \) to be a unit vector from the mass center of the rigid body towards an undesired pointing direction and represented in the inertial reference frame.
For example, \( v \) may represent the inertial direction of a bright celestial object or the incoming direction of particles or other debris
It is further assumed that optical sensor has a strict non-exposure constraint with respect to the celestial object.
We formulate this hard constraint as
\begin{align}
	r^T R^T v \leq \cos \theta \, , \label{eqn:constraint}
\end{align}
where \( \ang{0} \leq \theta \leq \ang{90}  \) is the required minimum angular separation between \( r \) and \( R^T v \). 
The objective is to a determine a control input \( u \) that stabilizes the system from an initial attitude \( R_0 \) to a desired attitude \( R_d \) while ensuring that~\refeqn{eqn:constraint} is always satisfied.

\section{Attitude Control on $\SO$ with Inequality Constraints}
The first step in designing a control system on a nonlinear manifold \( \Q \) is the selection of a proper configuration error function.
This configuration error function, \( \Psi : \Q \times \Q \to \R \), is a smooth and proper positive definite function that measures the error between the current configuration and a desired configuration.
Once an appropriate configuration error function is chosen, one can then define a configuration error vector and a velocity error vector in the tangent space \( \mathsf{T}_q \Q \) through use of the derivatives of \( \Psi \)~\cite{bullo2004}.
With the configuration error function and vectors the remaining procedure is similar to nonlinear control design on Euclidean vector spaces.
One chooses control inputs as functions of the state through a Lyapunov analysis on \Q.

A new configuration error function is proposed for attitude control in the presence of state inequality constraints.
We extend the form used in~~\cite{bullo2004,lee2011a} for attitude control on \SO with the addition of a logarithmic barrier function.
\begin{prop}[Attitude Error Function] \label{prop:config_error}
We assume a desired attitude command \( ( R_d, \Omega_d = 0 ) \), the current attitude and angular velocity \( ( R, \Omega) \), and a state constraint~\refeq{eqn:constraint} are given.
We define an attitude error function \( \Psi : \SO \times \SO \to \R \), and attitude error vector \( e_R : \SO \times \SO \to \R \), and an angular velocity error vector \( e_\Omega : \R^3 \to \R^3 \) as follows:
\begin{gather}
	\Psi(R) = A(R) B(R) \, , \label{eqn:psi} \\
	e_R = e_{R_A} B + A e_{R_B} \, , \label{eqn:eR} \\
	e_\Omega = \Omega \, , \label{eqn:eW}
\end{gather}
with
\begin{gather}
	A(R) = \frac{1}{2} \tr{G \left( I - R_d^T R\right)} \, , \label{eqn:A} \\
	B(R) = 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln \left( \frac{\cos \theta -  r^T R^T v}{1 + \cos \theta}\right) \, . \label{eqn:B} \\
	e_{R_A} = \frac{1}{2} \parenth{G R_d^T R - R^T R_d G} ^ \vee \, , \label{eq:eRA} \\
	e_{R_B} = \frac{ \left( R^T v\right)^\vee r}{\alpha \left(r^T R^T v - \cos \theta \right)} \, . \label{eq:eRB} 
\end{gather}	
where the matrix \( G \in \R^{3 \times 3} \) is defined as a diagonal matrix matrix for distinct, positive constants \( g_1, g_2, g_3 \in \R \).
Then, the following properties hold
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \(\Psi\) is locally positive definite about \( R = R_d\)
	\item The variation of \( \Psi \) with respect to a variation of \( \delta R = R \hat{\eta} \) for \( \eta \in \R^3 \) is given by
	\begin{align}
		\dirDiff{\Psi}{R} &= \dirDiff{A}{R} \,  B(R) + A \,  \dirDiff{B}{R} \, , \\
		\dirDiff{A}{R} &= \eta \cdot e_{R_A} \, , \\
		\dirDiff{B_i}{R} &= \eta \cdot e_{R_{B_i}} \, .
	\end{align}
	\item The critical points of \( \Psi \),where \( e_R = 0\), are \( \braces{R_d} \bigcup \braces{R_d \exp(\pi \hat{s}} \) for \( s \in \braces{e_1, e_2, e_3} \) and \( R^T v = \pm r \).
	\item An upper bound of \( \norm{e_{R_A}} \) is given as:
	\begin{align}
		\norm{e_{R_A}}^2 \leq \frac{\Psi}{b_1} \, ,
	\end{align}
	where the constant \( b_1 \) is given by \( b_1 = \frac{h_1}{h_2 + h_3} \) for 
	\begin{align*}
		h_1 &= \min{g_1 + g_2, g_2 + g_3 , g_3 + g_1} \, ,\\
		h_2 &= \min{\parenth{g_1 -g_2}^2,\parenth{g_2 -g_3}^2 , \parenth{g_3 -g_1}^2} \, ,\\
		h_3 &= \min{\parenth{g_1 + g_2}^2, \parenth{g_2 + g_3}^2 , \parenth{g_3 + g_1}^2} \, ,\\				
	\end{align*}
	\item An upper bound of \( \norm{e_{R_B}} \) is given as:
	\begin{align}
		\norm{e_{R_B}} \leq \frac{\sin{\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta}}{\alpha \parenth{\beta - \cos \theta}}
	\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	See~\Cref{proof:config_error}
\end{proof}

Discussion of error function

Give some bounds on B?

The attractive error function has been used for attitude control on \SO.
In order to incorporate the state inequality constraints we apply the logarithmic barrier function.
The positive constant \( \alpha \) serves to shape the barrier function.
As \( \alpha \) is increased the impact of \( B(R) \) is reduced. 

\Cref{eqn:psi} is composed of an attractive term \( A (R) \) and a repulsive term \( B(R) \) which are given by
